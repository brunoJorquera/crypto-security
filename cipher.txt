Cybersecurity Research Essay (Part 3):

 In October of 2017, Yahoo was hacked and over 1 billion user accounts were compromised.
Security questions and answers were the focus, and many users had their information leaked.
The reasoning behind the breach was not specifically identified, but could be inferred that
the hack was done in order to steal identities and personal info. Possible conspiracies point to
the hack being done for reasons relating to the sale of yahoo to verizon. 
    The cause of this hack can be traced to a mass spear-phishing ordeal that caused many users to reveal their own 
information. Many security questions were too easy or too obvious, allowing many hackers to access user accounts through
said phishing. Yahoo updated security measures by changing security questions and requiring that their members update their info.
In addition to changing questions, Yahoo also asked users to update their info so that their new info could be encrypted again.
Users were asked to update their info because this new form of encryption was more secure and much more efficient than the last form.
